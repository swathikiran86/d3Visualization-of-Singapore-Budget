# d3v5Visualization

Visualization of budget expenditure of Singapore (known to be the quickest nation to develop in a short span) using D3 JS, AngularJS, NodeJS and MySQL. This study is to analyze their budget expenditures for over the last 2 decades; not just with the numbers but also in specific areas where the money was/is being invested.
The below are the questions I would like to investigate by visualizing their budget expenditure data.
1) Which is the most funded sector amongst all the sectors and why?
2) Any drastic changes in their expenditure in recent years?
3) Which is the most funded ministry and why?
